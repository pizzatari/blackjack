TODO List
---------

Bugs:
    * No double down option given on 2nd split hand (P0). The option
      was offered and taken on 1st split hand (P1).
    * Inactive split hand occasionally flickers in color.
        - flickers when gamestate = 11 (player set flags)

New Rules:
    * consider implementing 5-card Charlie.
      https://blackjackdoc.com/5-card-charlie-blackjack-rule.htm

Animation:
    * Consider re-implementing the animation queue using the task queue.

Logic:
    * Bug: Hand was 7,7 then split to:
      Hand 1: 7,8,10 (25) - bust
      Hand 2: 7,7,9 (23) - bust
      The dealer dealt until 22!

User Interface:
    * Make denominations reflect the number of player chips

Done:
    * Re-shuffle the cards when the number of decks change.
    * DealCard is not correctly restricting the dealt cards to the number of decks.
    * Expanded task data structures from a nibble to a byte to support
      more than 15 tasks.
    * Rewrote the kernel to release 12 bytes of RAM  
        - The new kernel uses a single buffer for graphic pointers instead of two.
        - This required interlacing pointer assignment inside the card rendering.
        - The difficulty was finding an efficient way to render the gap space
          between the rank and suit during the card flipping animation.
    * Split Hit and Stay into separate menu options
    * Changed input handling to make the trigger button select menu actions.
      This allows multiple hands to be played by only pressing the fire button.
      Pushing/pulling the joystick for hit and stay is still supported.
    * Moved prompts to middle of the screen
    * Implemented selection of 1, 2, and 4 decks.
    * Implemented options display on betting screen showing selected game options.
    * Implemented a new pseudorandom generator.
    * The kernel stack got very close to the end allocated memory. Converted
      some subroutines to be inline.
    * On opening deal, show the face down card until it is actually dealt.
    * Bug: Hole card doesn't flip animate when dealer wins with a blackjack.
    * Bug: On a 21 push, status displays Winner momentarily before displaying Push 
    * Bug: On blackjack push, status displays BlackJack! but plays Push sound clip
    * Bug: Winner! message occasionally flickers.
    * Fixed betting screen glitch on the 1st frame, which momentarily showed
      graphics in wrong positions.
    * Expanded the sound driver to be support playing two sound clips.
    * player score momentarily shows wrong score when shifting cards off.
        - 5, A, A, 2, 3, 4, 8 (shows 16 -> 21 -> 24)
    * BUG: Bank1.DealCard has a severe flaw. Discarded cards are being dealt
      because the SearchDiscardPile routine is not returning a new card
      and DealCard is ignoring it.
